# TFL-Station-Footfall-Analysis
### Introduction 
This project analyzes daily footfall data from TFL train stations across London between 2019 and 2024. Using metrics such as average daily usage, seasonality dependency, and footfall volatility, stations have been segmented into functional groupsâ€”including Low Footfall Stops, Residential Connectors, and Busy Interchanges. The core focus is on understanding patterns of station usage and building a data-driven framework for station classification based on zone and usage behavior.
